title: Exams again, but this time AI

## AI and me

This post is well overdue, because I've been struggling lately with how I feel about AI.  First, let's clarify that I'm talking about Generative AI, including LLMs (Large Language Model) and Image Generation.  I'm still pretty happy with Machine Learning, a subject that I've worked with extensively, and teach about.

I've started using these tools, slowly, but as is inevitable, more and more as I realized the possibility.  I have a pro ChatGPT account, as well as a Copilot account through BCIT.  I've started using it more, and I now have thoughts.


### The good

Like most, I'm captivated by images.  I fed it this image of my living room wall, and asked it to show me where to hang art:


<h5 align="center">

<br>
<img src="/images/AI_images/original_wall.jpeg" alt = "image of my wall" width="300">
<br>

</h5>

It didn't get everything correct, but I do enjoy this image:

<h5 align="center">

<br>
<img src="/images/AI_images/Wall1.png" alt = "ChatGPT imagining of my wall" width="300">
<br>

</h5>

As well as this one:
<br>
<img src="/images/AI_images/Wall2.png" alt = "ChatGPT imagining of my wall" width="300">
<br>

I especially like how it took the art I already had, and created new art, based on it.  Pretty interesting!

## The Bad.

I'm not alone in seeing an explosion of AI cheating among my students.  The tool exists, so it will be used.  But thanks to tools like Google Lens, all of the work I've done creating randomized exams in D2L is now useless - with a click of a button, an AI will work out an exam and solve it, earning a score between 45% and 80%.  (It's still pretty bad at math, and that is what I mostly teach)

As a result, I'm now back to mostly paper exams. Even then, students smuggle in phones and AI pens to feed my questions to an AI and get solutions back.  Right now, it feels like playing whack-a-mole against new cheating items.  A ruler that has a screen and sensor to communicate with AI!  Smart Glasses that have built in AI!  Smart watches!  It's a lot, not to mention good old "copy off of someone else"

## Randomized Exams: Reimagined.

Feel free to follow along with the latest iteration of my unending quest to make exams better on my [github](https://github.com/amygoldlist/D2L_exams/tree/main/R_to_Word)

In this iteration, I use all of the tools I've used before to output a Word file, which I can than edit with my team.

## The Gist
* Make a script (or a series of Rmd fiels with a wrapper) that when run, creates a new version of an exam, randomizing aspects or questions, including multi-part long answer, and multiple choice. 

* It should replicate Respondus (or my new favourite qcon), and upload text files with multiple choice questions, and do some randomization.  The options should be shuffled, as well as the questions.  

* It should replicate D2L by allowing Question Pools (pick 2 from the following 5 questions)

* It should randomize not just in numbers (arithmatic), but also have the ability to randomize nouns such as names, object, ect.

* The output should be a Word file, so that it can be sent to other instructors for editing, additions, fix page breaks, ect.


## Why not just go old school LaTeX?
Did I spend a good amount of time pondering whether to just use pure LaTeX?  Of course I did.  But one of my main aims is to be able to work with others in my department, and as beautiful as it is (and gives me full control over every aspect of layout), Word is a better choice.

Also, using an Rmarkdown format lets me do calculations and randomize all sorts of things as I go.

## What did I fail on?

I have my prototype working, and I gave an exam with it already (generating 4 separate versions).  It worked!  That saying:

* I failed on Tables that are centred and have borders.  The Rmd to Word seems to fail there, and for the tables I absolutely need (Calculator inputs), I'm using an image instead of text.

* If the question part of a Multiple Choice Question has a paragraph break, my randomizer fails.

* Probably more!

## You said this was about AI

Yes, yes I did.  This was the first big coding project I did using what I affectionaltely call "My AI Buddy".
