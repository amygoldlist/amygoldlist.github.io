## Generative AI: Images

I am going to preface this post with a warning: I'm an AI sceptic.  Do I believe that Machine Learning algorithms are capable of really incredible things?  Yes.  Do I think that the patterns revealed can be very useful?  Also yes.  Do I occassionaly use ChatGPT to make my grant applications sound more formal?  Yes, because my writing voice isn't very formal.  Do I also think that outsourcing creativity to an algorithm is deangerous?  Definitely.  Do I think that with more training data, GenAI can stop hallucinating?  No, I don't.  It can always make errors, and these errors can be quite bad.

However, I also just accepted a position of Program Head for an AI program.  As my loyal reader(s) know, I am a mathematician and data scientist, and I've spent a lot of time slowly studying the underlying algorithms making up a lot of our modern AI.

### Math?



### Making Pictures
What I think GenAI is good at is working with humans to come up with solutions in cases where there are no wrong answers - coming up with fake data for my students, and making pictures, which is what I want to talk about today.

I started with a photo of my wall, where I would like to hang my art, so that it looks nice.  I gave ChatGPT some guidelines, and uploaded the following photo:
