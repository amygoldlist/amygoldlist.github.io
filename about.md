Hi! I'm Amy Goldlist, and I'm a mathematician, teacher, student, author, parent and data scientist.

Currently, I'm on leave from my faculty position in Operations Management in the School of Business at the British Columbia Institute of Technology, [BCIT](https://www.bcit.ca/business/).  I'm currently completing an [MDS](https://ubc-mds.github.io/) (Masters of Data Science) at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/), where incidentally I received my MSc in Mathematics years ago.  I also have an Honours BSc from [the University of King's College](https://ukings.ca/) and [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/), coincidentally also in Math.

An author you say?  Feel free to purchase [Essentials of Business Statistics](http://wileyplus.wiley.com/essentials-of-business-statistics-canadian-edition/), available through Wiley.
