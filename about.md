Hi! I'm Amy Goldlist, and I'm a mathematician, teacher, student, author, parent and data scientist.

Currently, I'm on leave from my faculty position in Operations Management in the School of Business at [BCIT](https://www.bcit.ca/business/) (British Columbia Institute of Technology.)  I'm currently completing an [MDS](https://ubc-mds.github.io/) (Masters of Data Science) at UBC, (where incidentally I received my MSc in Mathematics years ago.)

An author you say?  Feel free to purchase [Essentials of Business Statistics](http://wileyplus.wiley.com/essentials-of-business-statistics-canadian-edition/), available through Wiley.

Want to see some of my projects?  I have a [github](https://github.com/amygoldlist) account with a sample of projects I've worked on.
