Check out our new [Open Online Textbook](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/businessmathematics/).

I'm proud to be part of the team transforming our BCIT Business Math group notes to a proper Online resource.  Bonus: if you thought to yourself: I wish I could watch all of Amy's videos explaining Business Math Concepts, but accompanied by a proper textbook, you are in luck: All of my YouTube videos are embedded in the book!

This book will continue to expand, as my colleagues add H5P content to make interactive exercises.  See an error?  You can use the Pressbooks comment function, and I will swoop in and fix.
