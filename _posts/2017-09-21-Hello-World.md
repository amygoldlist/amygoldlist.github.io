Hi! I'm Amy Goldlist, and I'm a mathematician, teacher, student, and parent.

Currently, I'm on leave from my faculty position in Operations Management in the School of Business at BCIT (British Columbia Institute of Technology.)  I'm currently completing an MDS (Masters of Data Science) at UBC, (where incidentally I received my MSc in Mathematics a few years ago.)
