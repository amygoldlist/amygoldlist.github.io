Ever wished you could spend hours listening to me talk about math, while watching me.... writing about math?  I thought so!

Come see my new [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6Dzvh0MxrUoqbeL6XfQD3g), where you will see some of the videos I created for the courses I taught this past remote year.  Enjoy!
