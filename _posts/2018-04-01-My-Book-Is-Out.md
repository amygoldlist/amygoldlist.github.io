## Canadian Edition
### _By Ken Black, Ignacio Castillo, Amy Goldlist, and Timothy Edmunds_

**Essentials of Business Statistics, First Canadian Edition** offers a more student-friendly, applications-based approach to teaching a course that is generally perceived as being very technical. Students learn how and why statistical tools are used and benefit from a walk-through approach where new concepts are applied to clear examples.
