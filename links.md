## Some Projects of mine
- [Baby Name selector](https://goldlist.shinyapps.io/Baby_Name_Visualizer/), an R shiny app that let's you explore the popularity of baby names.

- [Student Performance Prediction](https://github.com/amygoldlist/student_performance_predictions/blob/master/report.md), in which I use some machine learning techniques to see if I can predict math grades based on demographics.  Spoiler: I don't succeed.


## Cool Packages I contribute to:
  -  [ptoolkit](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/ptoolkit), an R package to adjust p-values for multiple comparisons/

  - [p_toolkit](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/p_toolkit_Python), a python module that also adjusts p-values for multiple comparisons.

  - [LufthansaR](https://github.com/peter0083/LufthansaR), an R package that lets you interact with the Lufthansa API and get updated flight information.

  - [aggRviz](https://github.com/amygoldlist/aggRviz), an R package to organize and visualize data that is in aggregated form.

## Math


* For a taste of the type of math what I used to work on, here are the slides from a talk I gave in March 2007 on <a href="Recurrencetalk.pdf"> Maximal Divisors Of Certain Quartic Linear Recurrences</a>.<br>  

* Feel free to check out my Master's Essay, <a href="classnumber.pdf">The Only Quadratic Imaginary Fields With Class Number One Are...</a> <BR>

* Or, if your tastes run more to Combinatorial Game Theory, you can check out my undergraduate Honours Project, <a href="games.pdf">The Game of Geography</a>.

## Bonus

* Ever seen me working on a cool looking puzzle that I printed off of the internet?  check out [Kwon-Tom Loop](https://kwontomloop.com/), and sign up for a free account to print off your own puzzles.  Speaking of puzzles, I enjoy [lightbulbs](https://www.puzzle-light-up.com/) as well.
