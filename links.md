## Some Projects
- [Baby Name selector](https://goldlist.shinyapps.io/Baby_Name_Visualizer/), an R shiny app that let's you explore the popularity of baby names.  If you want to see the code, it's available on [github](https://github.com/amygoldlist/baby_names).

- [Student Performance Prediction](https://github.com/amygoldlist/student_performance_predictions/blob/master/report.md), in which I use some machine learning techniques to see if I can predict math grades based on demographics.  Spoiler: I don't succeed (and I'll argue this is a good thing, because anyone from any background can succeed at learning math).

- [Star Wars vs Star Trek](https://github.com/amygoldlist/geek_sw_vs_st), a team project where we attempted to find a scientific answer to the questions "Does preference for Star Trek over Star Wars increase with geekiness?"  Spoiler: It doesn't.  But you can take our [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqOI6W16UiiSh5LFngb5gjdM1ZHqsQ4zXytjOKEWQunqeUjA/viewform) and read the [conclusions](https://github.com/amygoldlist/geek_sw_vs_st/blob/master/doc/report.md) and see if you agree.  Bonus:  If you like reproducibility, you can run the entire analysis through the attached dockerfile.


## Cool Packages I contribute to:
  -  [ptoolkit](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/ptoolkit), an R package to adjust p-values for multiple comparisons.

  - [p_toolkit](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/p_toolkit_Python), a python module that also adjusts p-values for multiple comparisons.

  - [LufthansaR](https://github.com/peter0083/LufthansaR), an R package that lets you interact with the Lufthansa API and get updated flight information.  I recommend installing and running `LufthansaR::get_flight_status("AC123")` to fin out whether my favourite Toronto/Vancouver flight is running to schedule.

  - [aggRviz](https://github.com/amygoldlist/aggRviz), an R package to organize and visualize data that is in aggregated form. At present, this is still in development stage, but is due for its first release very soon.

## Math


* For a taste of the type of math what I used to work on, here are the slides from a talk I gave in March 2007 on <a href="Recurrencetalk.pdf"> Maximal Divisors Of Certain Quartic Linear Recurrences</a>.<br>  

* Feel free to check out my Master's Essay, <a href="classnumber.pdf">The Only Quadratic Imaginary Fields With Class Number One Are...</a> <BR>

* Or, if your tastes run more to Combinatorial Game Theory, you can check out my undergraduate Honours Project, <a href="games.pdf">The Game of Geography</a>.

## Bonus

* Ever seen me working on a cool looking puzzle that I printed off of the internet?  check out [Kwon-Tom Loop](https://kwontomloop.com/), and sign up for a free account to print off your own puzzles.  Speaking of puzzles, I enjoy [lightbulbs](https://www.puzzle-light-up.com/) as well.

* Interested in art?  I enjoy painting, particularly copying some of my favourite artists: Van Gogh, Tom Thompson, Ted Harrison, Roy Henry Vickers to name a few.  You can check out my work [here](https://knockoffart.blogspot.com/).

* Do you like computer games that are entirely logic based?  Check out my favourite game designer, [Everett Kaser Software](http://www.kaser.com/) which I have been buying and playing since... Well I don't remember.  I feel like I might have had Sherlock on MD DOS?
