Hi! I'm Amy Goldlist, and I'm a mathematician, teacher, student, author, parent and data scientist.

Currently, I'm on leave from my faculty position in Operations Management in the School of Business at BCIT (British Columbia Institute of Technology.)  I'm currently completing an MDS (Masters of Data Science) at UBC, (where incidentally I received my MSc in Mathematics years ago.)

An author you say?  Feel free to purchase [Essentials of Business Statistics](http://wileyplus.wiley.com/essentials-of-business-statistics-canadian-edition/), available through Wiley.

Want to see some of my projects?  I have a [github](https://github.com/amygoldlist) account with a sample of projects I've worked on.
