Hi! I'm Amy Goldlist, and I'm a mathematician, teacher, student, author, parent and data scientist.
I am faculty in Operations Management in the School of Business + Media at BCIT (British Columbia Institute of Technology.)  I am Program Head of AI Management!  I used to be Program Head of Business Analytics! Before that I was Program Head for Business Math.  Also, Academic Coordinator.  That's a lot!

An author you say?  Feel free to purchase [Essentials of Business Statistics](http://wileyplus.wiley.com/essentials-of-business-statistics-canadian-edition/), available through Wiley.
